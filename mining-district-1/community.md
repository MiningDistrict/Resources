# Community&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Mining District navigates euphoria as a collective, working together to mitigate the upside and downside risks of each investment opportunity. It is for this reason that we successfully scaled out of our long-term positions during the peak mania phase of the previous crypto bull run. Since then we have been managing smaller positions carefully while preparing for the next cycle.

### PvP

Towards the end of every market cycle, the gloves come off. When the inflow of capital from speculative retail scales back, the true faces of investors and their revered projects are unmasked. \
\
This often manifests as delusion: while Bitcoin is bleeding against the dollar and altcoins are bleeding against Bitcoin, those that have not yet come to terms with the macro downtrend remain assured that the current price action is only temporary. Even worse, they take to Twitter to have you believe it too. Delusion en masse produces a player-versus-player environment, where undisciplined investors -- surrounded by conflicting market sentiment -- bleed capital due to poor decision making. \
\
The macro downtrend also leads to the collapse of many crypto projects, whose temporary bouncy-castle-like residencies were inflated only by the upward momentum of recycled bullish energy. In the short term, the failure of such projects is a pain point for many investors. However, long term, their demise is a necessary cleansing of the growing asset class. \

**Many experienced investors revel in player-versus-player market environments. Why do you think that is?**

### PvE

Influencers, 'shillers' and marketers understand and take advantage of the shortcomings of individual investors. They guide them down paths that primarily benefit themselves, with little to no true concern for the investor's end state. The success of all influencers rests upon their ability to prophesize and actualise revenue-generating events. Under the right market conditions (such as mid-2020) those with large followings were extremely productive in doing so. However, as the market wanes and the followers disperse, the remnants of each shiller's influence remain bare, for all to see.\
****\
****A strategy for success in bullish and bearish markets alike is a players-versus-environment mindset. Accepting the crypto space for what it truly is at present, i.e., highly speculative, naturally leads to this style of community-based thinking, especially for newcomers. Simply put, no one can comprehend everything about all existing and upcoming projects. Knowing whose opinion to trust and what course of action to take based upon it is therefore vital for success. This level of trust is precious and should be built carefully over a significant period of time.\

Mining District's community is built from the ground up. No one is leading and no one is following. We succeed by working as a collective.
