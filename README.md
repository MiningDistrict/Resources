# Mining District

## Introduction

> Mining District brings together long-term, community-driven investors who are interested in increasing their portfolio's exposure to cryptocurrencies while carefully managing the inherent risk associated with the asset class.&#x20;

### Background

Over the past three years, Mining District's team has witnessed DeFi yield-bearing products rise and fall: 'degen' yield farms in 2020, OlympusDAO-style 'DeFi 2.0' assets in 2021 and NFT whitelist marketplaces in 2022. During times of peak euphoria, all of these projects were extremely profitable. And yet, at present, OHM is at a 98.5% drawdown of its all-time high price point.

We are yet to witness a yield-bearing DeFi projecy stand the test of time. _Why is this?_ Simply put, 'yielding value' is a facade. Value cannot be created from nothing. The recent demise of Terra's algorithmic stable coin UST is further evidence of this claim. 20% annual yield from a 'stable coin' equated to Terra paying $7M per day in inflation costs, leaving them wide open for attack. The collapse of UST and Luna wiped out tens of billions of dollars from the DeFi space in a matter of hours.

### Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me

No investor buys a native farming token with the intention of losing money. Investors do not brandish themselves with game-theoretic sentiment because they believe their favourite token is undercollateralized. Young adults do not 'grind' for tens of hours at a time for a whitelist mint of the hottest NFT project because they assume the project will rug pull.\
\
Yet time after time after time, investors are ultimately left out in the cold, bewildered by the shortcomings of the projects they were once so keen to advertise to their peers. _Are the critical issues of such projects opaque?_ Certainly not for everyone. Experienced DeFi community members frequently call out poor quality projects, warning investors of prospective pitfalls.\

In the tweet below, the infamous GCR calls out Do Kwon regarding UST's outlandish yield.&#x20;

Two months after this tweet was sent, Luna is almost worthless. GCR made over $10M shorting Luna. Did any of his profits come out of your pocket? Were you buying the Luna dip again and again? _Why were so many investors caught off guard by UST?_ On reflection, it is straightforward to surmise that they bought into two false narratives: (1) an algorithmic stable coin pegged to the dollar will always be worth (approximately) one dollar; (2) yielding 20% annually is low risk. Both of these beliefs are false. Unfortunately for a lot of investors, by the time the truth came to light for them, their investments had already decreased in value by 95%.

## FOMO vs Alpha

![Degeneracy works until it doesn't](https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS6w8dINEg1DoHSg2DBoCdjG3bWSu2-1bBhWLvk=s900-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj)

In a space that unironically prides itself on its own degeneracy and volatility, it is easy to become blindsided by the fear of missing out and relative risk. Compared to many other tokens, UST's 20% annual yield could be interpreted as conservative. However, most tokens with a thousand-percentage-plus annual yield devalue within the first couple of days. Therefore the comparison is meaningless. UST's one dollar value could be interpreted as conservative with respect to many other tokens that are worth tens of thousands of dollars. However, UST's initial supply and inflationary properties made it a top-three cryptocurrency by market cap. Do you know of any reputable exchanges offering a 20% annual yield on Bitcoin and Ethereum?\

The examples we have covered demonstrate that 'alpha' is key in navigating the current landscape forged by modern-day cryptocurrencies. Alpha is nothing more than useful information sourced from individuals or groups deemed to be knowledgeable and trustworthy. District Mining places its community at the centre of its operations for precisely this reason. In doing so, we have managed to successfully extract high value from the fast-paced cryptocurrency space since early 2020. If you have been burned during this time and seek refuge. Then join us and contribute what you can.
