# Mining District

## Introduction

> Mining District brings together long-term, community-driven investors who are interested in increasing their portfolio's exposure to cryptocurrencies while carefully managing the inherent risk associated with the asset class.&#x20;

### Background

Over the past two years, Mining District's team has witnessed DeFi yield-bearing platforms rise and fall, for instance popular 'degen' farms in 2020, OlympusDAO-style 'DeFi 2.0' projects in 2021 and NFT whitelist marketplaces in 2022. \
\
During times of peak euphoria, all of these yield-bearing products were extremely profitable. And yet, at present, OHM is at a 98.5% drawdown of its all-time high price point:

We are yet to witness a yield-bearing DeFi product stand the test of time. _Why is this?_ Simply put, 'yielding value' is a facade. Value cannot be created from nothing. The recent demise of Terra's algorithmic stable coin UST is further evidence of this claim. 20% annual yield from a 'stable coin' equated to Terra paying $7MM per day in inflation costs, leaving them wide open for attack. The collapse of UST and Luna wiped out tens of billions of dollars from the DeFi space in a matter of hours.\
\
No investor buys a native farming token with the intention of losing money. Investors do not brandish themselves with game-theoretic snippets because they believe their investments are undercollateralized. Teenagers do not 'grind' for tens of hours at a time for the hottest NFT projects because they assume the project will rug pull.\
\
Yet, time after time after time, investors are left out in the cold, bewildered by the shortcomings of the projects they were once so keen to advertise to their peers.
