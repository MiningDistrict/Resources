# Mining District

## Introduction

> The Mining District platform brings together long-term, community-driven investors who are interested in increasing their portfolio's exposure to cryptocurrencies while carefully managing the inherent risk associated with the asset class.&#x20;

### Background

Over the past two years, the Mining District team has witnessed DeFi yield-bearing platforms rise and fall, such as popular 'degen' farms in 2020, OlympusDAO-style 'DeFi 2.0' projects in 2021, and most recently NFT whitelist marketplaces in 2022.&#x20;

During times of peak euphoria, all of these yield-bearing products were extremely profitable. And yet at present, OHM is at a 98.5% drawdown of its all time high price point:

The demise of algorithmic stable coins (Terra and Tomb) has demonstrated that there is much work to be done&#x20;
