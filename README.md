# Mining District

## Introduction

> The Mining District platform brings together long-term, community-driven investors who are interested in increasing their portfolio's exposure to cryptocurrencies while carefully managing the inherent risk associated with the asset class.&#x20;

### Background

Over the past two years, the Mining District team has witnessed DeFi 1.0 yield-bearing platforms rise and fall, such as popular 'degen' farms in 2020 and NFT staking contracts in 2021 and 2022.&#x20;
